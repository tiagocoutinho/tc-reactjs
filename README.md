## Developers

build:
    npm run build

build monitor:
    npm run watch

run (using build monitor):
    npm run server

### Personal notes

* webpack to bundle everything
* mockaroo.com to generate some mock data
* lodash.js to intepret mock data
* react.js (developers: might want to install react-dev-tools (chrome, firefox))
